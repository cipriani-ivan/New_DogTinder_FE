# New_DogTinder_FE
For the front-end I have used Angular with NX and swagger to generate client library.
The UI and user experience is limited, and the idea is to implement in the future share components for a common user experience through the application so, to reduce the duplicate code.
Interceptor and guard are used to add the bear token to the API call to the appointment that required authentication and authorization. So, a Login is required before to create an appointment. 
Jest for unit test and Playwrigth for end-to-end test are used.
This is not a TDD project but from now on I could start to code with this methodology in mind.
